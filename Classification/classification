 In classification you have a set of predefined classes and want to know which class a new object belongs to.
 Examples:
    assigning a given email to the "spam" or "non-spam" class
    assigning a diagnosis to a given patient based on observed characteristics of the patient (gender)

 classification is considered an instance of supervised learning --> where a training set of correctly identified observations is available

Supervised Learning
    1. Classification
    2. Linear regression

Regression:
1. simple linear regression -->
    There is one dimension for the response variable and another dimension for the explanatory variable, making a total of two dimensions
    y = α + β x (α & β are the the parameters  of the model that are learned by the learning algorithms)
    best fitting model is called "ordinary least squares" or "linear least squares".

    Evaluating:
        model.score(X_test, y_test)

2. Multiple Linear Regression
    y = α + β1 x 1 + β 2 x2 + ⋅⋅⋅ + βn xn

3. Polynomial regression
    y = α + β1 x + β2 x2

* Regularization is a collection of techniques that can be used to prevent over-fitting.
* Occam's razor states that a hypothesis with the fewest assumptions is the best.
* Accordingly, regularization attempts to find the simplest model that explains the data.
