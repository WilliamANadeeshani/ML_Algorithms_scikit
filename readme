ML Basic Algorithms

************************************************Classification************************************************************************


* In classification you have a set of predefined classes and want to know which class a new object belongs to.
  Examples:
    assigning a given email to the "spam" or "non-spam" class
    assigning a diagnosis to a given patient based on observed characteristics of the patient (gender)

*classification is considered an instance of supervised learning --> where a training set of correctly identified observations is available

Supervised Learning
    1. Classification
    2. Linear regression

Regression:
        1. simple linear regression -->
            There is one dimension for the response variable and another dimension for the explanatory variable, making a total of two dimensions
            y = α + β x (α & β are the the parameters  of the model that are learned by the learning algorithms)
            best fitting model is called "ordinary least squares" or "linear least squares".

            Evaluating:
                model.score(X_test, y_test)

        2. Multiple Linear Regression
            y = α + β1 x 1 + β 2 x2 + ⋅⋅⋅ + βn xn

        3. Polynomial regression
            y = α + β1 x + β2 x2

        * Regularization is a collection of techniques that can be used to prevent over-fitting.
        * Occam's razor states that a hypothesis with the fewest assumptions is the best.
        * Accordingly, regularization attempts to find the simplest model that explains the data.

extracting features from categorical variables
extracting features from text

    Features:
        categorical / nominal / continuous

    Feature Encoding:
        categorical --> one-of-K or one-hot --> order is important --> cities
        bag of word --> uses a feature vector with an element for each of the words in the corpus's vocabulary to represent each document.
        bag-of-words with TF-IDF weights -->  create feature vectors that encode the frequencies of words
            we can see that words that are common to many of the documents in the corpus, such as sandwich, have been penalized.
        Space-efficient feature vectorizing with the hashing trick



    High-dimensional feature vectors that have many zero-valued elements are called sparse vectors.
    problems:
        The first problem is that high-dimensional vectors require more memory than smaller vectors.
        The second problem is known as the curse of dimensionality, or the Hughes effect.
            As the feature space's dimensionality increases,
            more training data is required to ensure that there are enough training instances with each combination of the feature's values.

    solutions:
        1. stop word filtering
        2. Stemming and lemmatization
            Lemmatization is the process of determining the lemma, or the morphological root, of an inflected word based on its context. --> use lexical resource
            Stemming removes all patterns of characters that appear to be affixes, resulting in a token that is not necessarily a valid word. --> use rules

****************************************************Perceptron********************************************************************

The perceptron's preactivation.
    y = φ  ∑ wi xi + b 
    1. unit function
    2.logistic sigmoid activation function.
        g ( x ) = 1/(1+e-x)

The perceptron learning algorithm
    1. begins by setting the weights to zero or to small random values.
        it is an error-driven learning algorithm -->
            if the prediction is correct, the algorithm continues to the next instance.
            If the prediction is incorrect, the algorithm updates the weights.

        wi( t + 1) = wi( t ) + α( dj − yj( t ) ) xji ; for all feature 0 ≤ i ≤ n
            dj is the true class for instance j
            yj( t ) is the predicted class for instance j
            xji ,i is the value of the ith explanatory variable for instance j
            α is a hyperparameter that controls the learning rate
